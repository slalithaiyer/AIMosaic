# 🤖 Agentic Frameworks in AI

**Designing autonomous, goal-driven AI systems using LLMs, tools, and multi-agent orchestration.**

This project explores agentic frameworks — architectures that enable AI agents to perceive, reason, act, and reflect. These frameworks are foundational for building intelligent copilots, service desk agents, and multi-agent simulations.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- **LLMs as Reasoning Engines**  
  Use transformers to interpret tasks, generate plans, and adapt behavior.

- **Tool Integration**  
  Equip agents with APIs, search, and code execution capabilities.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**  
  Delegate tasks across specialized agents with memory and coordination.

- **Workflow Orchestration**  
  Build DAGs and event-driven flows using LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI.

- **Reflection & Memory**  
  Enable agents to learn from outcomes and improve over time.
