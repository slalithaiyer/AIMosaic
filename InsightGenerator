# 📊 AI for Business Intelligence

**Bringing AI into the heart of business performance, anomaly detection, and executive insight generation.**

This project explores how AI — including machine learning and large language models — can enhance Business Intelligence (BI) by detecting anomalies, monitoring KPIs, and generating narrative insights that drive better decisions.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  Identify outliers in KPIs, service desk volumes, and operational metrics using ML and LLMs.

- **Narrative BI**  
  Use LLMs to generate executive summaries and contextual insights from dashboards.

- **Root Cause Analysis**  
  Correlate anomalies with upstream events or logs using AI-powered reasoning.

- **KPI Monitoring & Alerting**  
  Define dynamic thresholds and trigger alerts based on learned patterns.

- **Dashboard Enhancement**  
  Embed AI-generated insights into BI platforms like Power BI and Tableau.

- **Scenario Simulation**  
  Use generative models to simulate “what-if” business scenarios.

- **Data Quality & Drift Detection**  
  Monitor BI pipelines for schema changes, missing values, or concept drift.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
