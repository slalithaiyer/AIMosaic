# ⚙️ AIOps & LLMOps

This section of AIMosaic explores how AI can be operationalized at scale — from traditional AIOps (monitoring, automation, anomaly detection) to the emerging field of LLMOps (prompt management, fine-tuning, and observability for large language models).

## 🔍 What's Inside

- **LLMOps**: Tools and workflows for managing LLMs in production
- **AIOps Core**: Infrastructure monitoring, alerting, and intelligent automation
- **Use Cases**: Service desk analytics, incident triage, model drift detection

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms

- MLflow, Weights & Biases
- LangChain, PromptLayer
- Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack
- Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch

## 📁 Subfolders

- `llmops/`: Prompt pipelines, fine-tuning strategies, LLM observability
- `aiops-core/`: Traditional AIOps workflows and automation scripts
- `assets/`: Diagrams and architecture visuals

> “AIOps is where models meet reality — and LLMOps is where they learn to adapt.”
